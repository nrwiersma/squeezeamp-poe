`SqueezeAMP PoE` is an amplifier driven by an ESP32 designed to run [squeezelite-esp32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32), powered by PoE++.

Features:

* Power over Ethernet 802.3bt 60W (PoE++)
* ESP32 WROOM 4MB Flash 8MB PSRAM
* TAS5756 Amplifier capable of driving stereo 30W 8Ohm speakers

## Why

The position of speakers is often not optimal for WiFi, leading to unreliable music streaming. Adding 100Mb ethernet allows
more reliable connections with ample bandwidth. Given an ethernet connection, PoE is able to provide power for the device.

The schematic is inspired by the [SqueezeAMPagain](https://github.com/hallo-alex/SqueezeAMPagain).

## Configuration

Install [squeezelite-esp32](https://github.com/sle118/squeezelite-esp32). The simplest method is to use the [installer](https://sle118.github.io/squeezelite-esp32-installer/).

Set the following configuration via the NVS Editor to configure:

dac_config: `model=TAS57xx,bck=33,ws=25,do=32,sda=27,scl=26,mute=4:0`
eth_config: `model=w5500,cs=15,speed=20000000,intr=18,rst=19`
spi_config: `mosi=13,clk=14,host=1,miso=12,dc=-1`
set_GPIO:   `2=spkfault`
